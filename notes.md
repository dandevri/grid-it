## 03 - Grid Fundamentals
Take any element on the page and you are going to display grid it.
You can slice and dice the container. Then we can place the items on the grid.

The columns and rows are called tracks. So no need to position.
When you display grid a container you make all of its direct children items.

Rows are automatically created if you only do columns.
Fractions will replace the need for percentages.

## 04 - Grid Dev Tools
Grid is pretty hard to visualize. They are not elements themselves.
Tracks are not numbered by the rows and columns but by the lines they start and stop them.

Solid line = explicit grid edge
Dashed = explicit
Dotted = implicit

## 05 - Implicit vs Explicit
If you do not create them, they are implicit.
Solid line explicit grids starts and stops.
By default you define your columns and then any extra elements wil lbe turned into rows.
Automatically columns instead of rows is auto-flow.

## 06 - Grid Autoflow
Autoflow will determine if you need another row or column.
Row is default.
